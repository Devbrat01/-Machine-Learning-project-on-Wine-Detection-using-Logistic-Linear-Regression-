# -Machine-Learning-project-on-Wine-Detection-using-Logistic-Linear-Regression-

This project analyzes and visualizes wine properties cases to uncover trends and correlations, using a provided dataset.
 
Objectives include data cleaning, trend visualization, and distribution analysis across countries, with interactive visualizations.

Methodology involves Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and NumPy for data processing and
visualization.

Expected outcomes : Predicting the wine variety  based on chemical properties & exploring relationship and patterns among wine samples.
